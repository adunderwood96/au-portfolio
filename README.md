# Ashley Underwood's Portfolio

## Challenge: 

- This Challenge's focus was to build a portfolio to showcase not only projects but who I am am as a web developer. The portfolio helps me better understand how to market myself, while implementing advance css and mobile accessability. While the portfolio is still a work in progress that will continue to evolve as, I, myself does; I got a better understanding of what is needed and what I need to continue to work on to improve my skills and vision.

#### Future Vision: to make a portfolio that looks like a book, with pages that flip!
